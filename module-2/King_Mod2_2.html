        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Zach</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">I grew up in a small town called Farmington that sits in Northern New Mexico. I spent a lot of time outdoors, enjoying nature and the fresh air. Being so close to Colorado, I would often go there to hike and explore the trails.</p>
        
        <p>I grew up with three brothers so you could assume my mom's stress level, but it was fun. She always kept it together. My aunts also played a big part in my childhood.</p>
        
        <p>I have several hobbies that keep me busy outside of work and school. One of my favorite hobbies is writing. I prefer poetry but any form of writing will do. I would like to get more into screenwriting for sure.</p>
        
        <p>I live in Chicago, Illinois now which is pretty crazy. It has been three years now and it's been interesting. I miss my family though, but I visit home at least once a year.</p>
        
        <span class="sentence">Completing this program and learning to code has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life.</span>
